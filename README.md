# emails
A script to scrap your outlook email and add the contents to a csv file

# How to use
First be logged in into the Outlook application on your laptop. This is enough to run the code. 
The only necessary change is the path on which the csv file gets saved. 

In order to scrape the main inbox, make the if statement in Cell 5 true. Otherwise, for delegated accounts or subfolders, let it remain false, and choose the index of the appropriate folder (The output of Cell 4 provides all the names and indexes needed)
